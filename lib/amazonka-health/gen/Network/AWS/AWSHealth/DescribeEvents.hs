-- Returns information about events that meet the specified filter criteria. Events are returned in a summary form and do not include the detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventDetails.html DescribeEventDetails> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntities.html DescribeAffectedEntities> operations.
--
-- If no filter criteria are specified, all events are returned. Results are sorted by @lastModifiedTime@ , starting with the most recent event.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
