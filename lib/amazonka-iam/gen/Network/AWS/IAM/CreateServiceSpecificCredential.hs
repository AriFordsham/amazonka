-- Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified service.
--
-- You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for each supported service per user.
-- The only supported service at this time is AWS CodeCommit.
-- You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling 'ResetServiceSpecificCredential' .
-- For more information about service-specific credentials, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html Using IAM with AWS CodeCommit: Git Credentials, SSH Keys, and AWS Access Keys> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
