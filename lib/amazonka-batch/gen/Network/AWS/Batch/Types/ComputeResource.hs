    maxvCpus :: Core.Int,
    -- | The instances types that may be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, @c5@ or @p3@ ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as @c5.8xlarge@ ). You can also choose @optimal@ to pick instance types (from the C, M, and R instance families) on the fly that match the demand of your job queues.
    instanceTypes :: [Types.String],
    -- | The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html VPCs and Subnets> in the /Amazon VPC User Guide/ .
    subnets :: [Types.String],
    -- | The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, @/ecsInstanceRole/ @ or @arn:aws:iam::/<aws_account_id>/ :instance-profile//ecsInstanceRole/ @ . For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html Amazon ECS Instance Role> in the /AWS Batch User Guide/ .
    instanceRole :: Types.String,
    -- | The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource in case not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This could be due to availability of the instance type in the region or <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html Amazon EC2 service limits> . If this is not specified, the default is @BEST_FIT@ , which will use only the best fitting instance type, waiting for additional capacity if it's not available. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with @BEST_FIT@ then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified. @BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE@ will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per vCPU. @SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED@ is only available for Spot Instance compute resources and will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html Allocation Strategies> in the /AWS Batch User Guide/ .
    allocationStrategy :: Core.Maybe Types.CRAllocationStrategy,

For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be below 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.

    -- | The Amazon EC2 key pair that is used for instances launched in the compute environment.
    ec2KeyPair :: Core.Maybe Types.String,
    -- | The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the @imageIdOverride@ member of the @Ec2Configuration@ structure.
    imageId :: Core.Maybe Types.String,
    -- | The launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a 'CreateComputeEnvironment' API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html Launch Template Support> in the /AWS Batch User Guide/ .
    launchTemplate :: Core.Maybe Types.LaunchTemplateSpecification,
    -- | The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html Placement Groups> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances/ .

    -- | The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in @securityGroupIds@ or using a launch template referenced in @launchTemplate@ . If security groups are specified using both @securityGroupIds@ and @launchTemplate@ , the values in @securityGroupIds@ will be used.
    securityGroupIds :: Core.Maybe [Types.String],
    -- | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a @SPOT@ compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to @BEST_FIT@ or if the allocation strategy is not specified. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role> in the /AWS Batch User Guide/ .

These tags can not be updated or removed after the compute environment has been created; any changes require creating a new compute environment and removing the old compute environment.
