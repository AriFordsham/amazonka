-- Lists all of the organizational units (OUs) or accounts that are contained in the specified parent OU or root. This operation, along with 'ListParents' enables you to traverse the tree structure that makes up this root.
--
-- This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a parent ID string requires one of the following:
--

--

--     * __Organizational unit (OU)__ - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the @NextToken@ response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the @NextToken@ request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check @NextToken@ after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    -- ^ The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a @NextToken@ response in a previous request. A @NextToken@ response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's @NextToken@ response to indicate where the output should continue from.
