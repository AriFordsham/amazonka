Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file.
-- Valid input values include: @dfxp@ (first div element only), @ebu-tt@ , @scc@ , @smpt@ , @srt@ , @ttml@ (first div element only), and @webvtt@
-- Valid outputs include: @dfxp@ (first div element only), @scc@ , @srt@ , and @webvtt@ .
--
--
-- If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.
-- Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process.
-- To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set @Captions@ to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the @MergePolicy@ to @MergeRetain@ , and pass in a null @CaptionSources@ array.

-- | /Important:/ (Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.
--
-- If you specify a preset in @PresetId@ for which the value of @Container@ is @fmp4@ (Fragmented MP4) or @ts@ (MPEG-TS), @SegmentDuration@ is the target maximum duration of each segment in seconds. For @HLSv3@ format playlists, each media segment is stored in a separate @.ts@ file. For @HLSv4@ , @MPEG-DASH@ , and @Smooth@ playlists, all media segments for an output are stored in a single file. Each segment is approximately the length of the @SegmentDuration@ , though individual segments might be shorter or longer.
-- The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration of the video is not evenly divisible by @SegmentDuration@ , the duration of the last segment is the remainder of total length/SegmentDuration.
-- Elastic Transcoder creates an output-specific playlist for each output @HLS@ output that you specify in OutputKeys. To add an output to the master playlist for this job, include it in the @OutputKeys@ of the associated playlist.
