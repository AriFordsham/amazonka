-- This operation is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to access it. The operation returns a @200 OK@ if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it. Otherwise, the operation might return responses such as @404 Not Found@ and @403 Forbidden@ .
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the @s3:ListBucket@ action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources> .

    -- When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ .s3-accesspoint./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name.
