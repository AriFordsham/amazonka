-- | Creates a value of 'ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rtarStatus' - Assessment run status.  This status can have one of the following values:     * @"cancelling"@ – The assessment run was canceled by the @CancelReplicationTaskAssessmentRun@ operation.     * @"deleting"@ – The assessment run was deleted by the @DeleteReplicationTaskAssessmentRun@ operation.     * @"failed"@ – At least one individual assessment completed with a @failed@ status.     * @"error-provisioning"@ – An internal error occurred while resources were provisioned (during @provisioning@ status).     * @"error-executing"@ – An internal error occurred while individual assessments ran (during @running@ status).     * @"invalid state"@ – The assessment run is in an unknown state.     * @"passed"@ – All individual assessments have completed, and none has a @failed@ status.     * @"provisioning"@ – Resources required to run individual assessments are being provisioned.     * @"running"@ – Individual assessments are being run.     * @"starting"@ – The assessment run is starting, but resources are not yet being provisioned for individual assessments.
--
-- * 'rtarResultKMSKeyARN' - ARN of the AWS KMS encryption key used to encrypt the assessment run results.
--
-- * 'rtarAssessmentProgress' - Indication of the completion progress for the individual assessments specified to run.
--
-- * 'rtarReplicationTaskAssessmentRunARN' - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this assessment run.
--
-- * 'rtarReplicationTaskAssessmentRunCreationDate' - Date on which the assessment run was created using the @StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun@ operation.
--
-- * 'rtarAssessmentRunName' - Unique name of the assessment run.
--
-- * 'rtarServiceAccessRoleARN' - ARN of the service role used to start the assessment run using the @StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun@ operation.
--
-- * 'rtarResultEncryptionMode' - Encryption mode used to encrypt the assessment run results.
--
-- * 'rtarReplicationTaskARN' - ARN of the migration task associated with this premigration assessment run.
--
-- * 'rtarLastFailureMessage' - Last message generated by an individual assessment failure.
--
-- * 'rtarResultLocationFolder' - Folder in an Amazon S3 bucket where AWS DMS stores the results of this assessment run.
--
-- * 'rtarResultLocationBucket' - Amazon S3 bucket where AWS DMS stores the results of this assessment run.
