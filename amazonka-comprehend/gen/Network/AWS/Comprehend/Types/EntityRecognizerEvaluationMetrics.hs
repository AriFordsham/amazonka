-- | Creates a value of 'EntityRecognizerEvaluationMetrics' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eremF1Score' - A measure of how accurate the recognizer results are for the test data. It is derived from the @Precision@ and @Recall@ values. The @F1Score@ is the harmonic average of the two scores. The highest score is 1, and the worst score is 0.
--
-- * 'eremPrecision' - A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results in the test data. High precision means that the recognizer returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones.
--
-- * 'eremRecall' - A measure of how complete the recognizer results are for the test data. High recall means that the recognizer returned most of the relevant results.
